# skeleton-api-node
A simple starting point for a Docker-based API running Node.js, with API tests in a different container.

While it is a simple 'hello world' app, I've tried to incorporate good security practices in order to give a starting place.

# Installation

1. Install Docker
2. Install Docker Compose
3. `docker-compose build`

## Development

* `docker-compose build && docker-compose up`
